GitHub hello world

Greetings people of Earth

I am a jack of all trades just adding more trades to my belt. I used to play around with git on the command line when I was using linux, but this is my first time really using github. I'm trying to learn Java and already know the basics of that and several other languages. Hoping to make the trasnsition from learning beginner material over and over ad. nauseum and then not using it, to actual deep knowledge of all the libraries and becoming a real programmer.
